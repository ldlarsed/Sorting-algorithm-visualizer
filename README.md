Sorting-algorithm-visualizer (student project)
============================

An intuitive application that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and demonstrate various sorting algorithms in real-time. Users can choose from different algorithms, such as bubble sort, quicksort, and merge sort, and observe how they work step-by-step. The app provides a visual representation of the sorting process, highlighting comparisons, swaps, and the overall performance of each algorithm. This tool is ideal for learning and teaching sorting algorithms, offering a clear and interactive way to understand their differences and efficiency.
